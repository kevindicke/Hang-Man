### How to play(if somehow you never have)

##### Both player enter their name in each name field. Then, out of sight of player 2, decides a word for player 2 to solve and press "Game On!!" then hand the computer over to player 2. That player will try to solve the word and has 6 chances to before the prisoner is hanged. Once Player 2 finishes solving or trying to solve the word, Player 2 decides a word for Player 1 to solce and presses"Game On!!!" then hands the computer over to player 1. After both player finishes their turn the winner will be displayed.. If you are unable to guess the word do not feel bad for the prisoner, he's a bad dude. Think Joffrey Baratheon from Game of Thrones.

### User story

##### As a player I want to be able to enter my name so it's easy to distinguish between me and the other player. As player 1 I want to be able to decide what word Player 2 will need to solve. As Player 2 I want to be able to decide what word Player 1 will need to solve. Once the second Player finished solving his word and want it to display the winners name. I also want to button on the winners display to start another game.
