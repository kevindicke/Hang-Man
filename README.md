# Hang Man

---

### How to play(if somehow you never have)

##### Out of sight of the other play, pick a word no longer than 6 characters and press "DONE" then hand the computer over to the other player. That player will try to guess the word and has 6 chances to before the prisoner is hanged. If you are unable to guess the word do not feel bad for the prisoner, he's a bad dude. Think Joffrey Baratheon from Game of Thrones.
