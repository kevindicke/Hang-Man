# Hang Man

###How to play(if somehow you never have)

#####Out of sight of the other play, pick a word no longer than 6 characters and press "DONE" then hand the computer over to the other player. The player trying to guess the word has 6 chances to before the prisoner is hanged. If you are unable to guess the word do not feel bad for the prisoner, he's a bad dude. Think Joffrey Baratheon from Game of Thrones.
